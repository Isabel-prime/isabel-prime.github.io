\textbf{Project Title} & \textbf{Supervisor} & \textbf{Description}\\
\hline

Derived Quiver Representations & Dr Asilata Bapat & \footnotesize This was my Honours project. I studied the bounded derived category of quiver representations for an acyclic quiver, and gave a proof that derived reflection functors are equivalences of triangulated categories. I also looked at the iterated weight filtration, which gives a canonical refinement of the Harder-Narasimhan filtration coming from a stability condition.
\normalsize\\

Crystals: Combinatorial Algorithms and Tensor Categories & Dr Noah White & \footnotesize In this lecture course, we developed the theory of braided and coboundary monoidal categories, and studied the induced actions by the braid and cactus groups. We also defined reflection groups and root systems before proving the classification of irreducible finite real reflection groups. We constructed crystals of semistandard tableaux for the ($GL_n$) root datum, and studied the RSK algorithm, Sch\"{u}tzenberger involution and Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.\normalsize\\

Algebraic \& Analytic Number Theory & Prof. Amnon Neeman & \footnotesize This reading course was devoted to various topics in modern number theory. The first half proved various standard results in algebraic number theory, such as the Kummer-Dedekind theorem, Minkowskiâ€™s bound and methods of computing the class group, working from Stevenhagen's \emph{Number Rings}. We then spent some time analysing techniques specific to Galois extensions of number fields. In the second half, we transitioned into analytic number theory, proving results such as the analytic class number formula. I gave a lecture presenting the proof of the prime number theorem.\normalsize\\

Riemann Surfaces & Dr Ian Le & \footnotesize This lecture course developed much of the important theory of Riemann surfaces, including the uniformization theorem, the existence of meromorphic functions on any compact Riemann surface, the classification of elliptic curves, and the Riemann-Roch formula. As a personal project, I wrote a short paper outlining the proof of Riemann-Roch for smooth 1-dimensional curves over finite fields. \normalsize\\

Three-Manifolds & Dr Joan Licata & \footnotesize This course was a broad survey of topics in 3-manifold theory, including Heegaard decompositions, (Dehn) surgery, Morse theory, Kirby calculus and more. As a personal project, I gave a talk and wrote a short paper on rational tangle replacement, and the equivalence between 2-fold cyclic branched covers of $S^3$ and manifolds obtained from $S^3$ via surgery on a strongly-invertible link. \normalsize\\

Foundations of Algebraic Geometry & Dr Anand Deopurkar & \footnotesize This reading course followed Ravi Vakilâ€™s \emph{The Rising Sea: Foundations of Algebraic Geometry} to develop the theory of sheaves on schemes. The first half focused on the construction and basic properties of schemes and their morphisms, while the second half introduced quasicoherent and coherent sheaves, line bundles and sheaf cohomology. \normalsize\\

Vector Bundles \& K-Theory & Dr Vigleik Angeltveit & \footnotesize This course was based on Hatcher's book draft \emph{Vector Bundles \& K-Theory}. It developed the theory of vector bundles on a topological space, defining topological K-theory and working through some applications. As a personal project, I studied Schubert calculus and the cohomology of Grassmannians, including the Pieri and Giambelli formulas and Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. \normalsize\\

Computational Algebraic Geometry & Dr Martin Helmer & \footnotesize This course gave a computational approach to modern algebraic geometry, developing algorithms and showing their applications using the language Macaulay2. As a personal project, I studied tropical algebraic varieties from the book \emph{Introduction to Tropical Geometry} by Maclagan and Sturmfels, building towards the Structure Theorem.\normalsize\\

Perverse Sheaves \& Deligne-Lusztig Theory & Dr Asilata Bapat \& Dr Uri Onn & \footnotesize This formal lecture course was divided into two sections. In the perverse sheaves component, we developed the theory of derived categories and t-structures on a triangulated category. We used this to study perverse sheaves and the perverse t-structure induced by a perversity function. The Deligne-Lusztig component was devoted to various classifications for characters on finite reductive groups, including parabolic induction and Deligne-Lusztig induction. \normalsize\\

Calculus on Manifolds & Prof. Ben Andrews & \footnotesize I followed the text \emph{Calculus on Manifolds} by Michael Spivak to learn the elementary theory of differential geometry. Ben Andrews provided resources to extend the project into the topics of Riemannian metrics and de Rham Cohomology.\normalsize\\

Combinatorial Game Theory in Lean & Prof. Scott Morrison & \footnotesize This project was an attempt to formalise the basic theory of Conway's combinatorial games in the interative theorem proving language Lean. While this theory is mostly elementary, it interacted in surprising ways with the inductive type system in Lean, and the difficulty of this project lay in proving well-foundedness of the necessary recursive definitions in Lean by choosing the right data types.\normalsize\\
