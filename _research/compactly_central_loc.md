We define a class of smashing localisations which we call _compactly central_, and classify compactly central localisations of $$Sp_{(p)}$$ and of $$Sp$$. Our main result is that $$L_n^f$$ is a compactly central localisation. 

A map $$\alpha: 1 \to A$$ in a presentably symmetric monoidal $$\infty$$-category $$\mathscr{C}$$ is _central_ if there exists a homotopy $$\alpha \otimes id_A \simeq id_A \otimes \alpha: A \to A \otimes A$$. A central map $$\alpha$$ can be used to produce a smashing localisation $$L_\alpha$$ of $$\mathscr{C}$$, because the free $$\mathbb{E}_1$$ algebra on the $$\mathbb{E}_0$$ algebra $$\alpha$$ is an idempotent commutative algebra. When the monoidal unit and $$A$$ are compact, we call $$L_\alpha$$ _compactly central_. We show that when $$\mathscr{C}$$ is (compactly generated) rigid, all compactly central localisations are finite in the sense of Miller. Not all finite localisations of $$Sp$$ are compactly central. To exhibit $$L_n^f$$ as compactly central, we determine properties of the $$K(n)$$-homology of a map between $$p$$-local finite spectra which ensure that some tensor power of the map is central.
