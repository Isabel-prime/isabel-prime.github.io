An expository talk given for the Harvard Thursday Seminar in Spring 2024, which was on the topic of the recent paper "K-theoretic counterexamples to Ravenel's telescope conjecture" by Burklund, Hahn, Levy, and Schlank. In this talk, I stated and gave proofs of the key theorems from "The algebraic $$K$$-theory of the $$K(1)$$-local sphere via $$TC$$" by Levy, including computation of the $$K$$-theory of the $$K(1)$$-local sphere in terms of $$TC$$ of the Adams summand, and an analogue to the Dundas-Goodwillie-McCarthy theorem for certain $$(-1)$$-connective rings. I also explained the Land-Tamme $\odot$ construction, which, given the input of a pullback square of $$\mathbb{E}_1$$-rings, allows comparison with a closely related commuting square which becomes a pullback under $$K$$-theory or another localizing invariant. The relevance of this talk to the seminar is that the counterexample to the telescope conjecture at height 2 is $$K(L_{K(1)}\mathbb{S})$$. [Notes](/files/k-theory-K(1)-local-sphere.pdf) are available.
