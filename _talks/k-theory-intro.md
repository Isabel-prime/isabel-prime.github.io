A 2-hour expository talk given for [Zygotop](https://nataliesstewart.github.io/zygotop/) in Fall 2023, a learning seminar for young graduate students interested in homotopy theory and related areas. I gave an introduction to algebraic $$K$$-theory, starting from the classical perspective and then spending some time on the universal constructions of connective and non-connective $$K$$-theory (in terms of the universal additive and localising invariant, respectively). I also discussed Waldhausen's $$wS_\bullet$$ construction, and we concluded with a summary of Quillen's computation of the $$K$$-theory of finite fields via the $$BGL(R)^+$$-construction. [Notes](/files/k-theory-intro.pdf) are available.
