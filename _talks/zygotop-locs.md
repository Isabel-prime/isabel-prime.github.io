A research talk I gave for [zygotop](https://zygotop.github.io/) in Spring 2025, on my forthcoming work. Given a central map in a presentably symmetric monoidal stable infinity category, one can build an idempotent algebra -- roughly speaking, as a colimit of successive tensor powers of the map -- and thus obtain a smashing localisation. From this perspective, a natural notion of finiteness arises. Namely, we call a localisation _compactly central_ if it can be constructed in this way beginning with a central map from the unit to a compact object. There is already a notion of finiteness for localisations which requires that the acyclics be generated under colimits by compact acyclics, and being compactly central turns out to in general be a stronger condition. We classify all compactly central localisations in spectra and in p-local spectra. In particular, the localisation $$L_n^f$$ is compactly central.
