An hour-long talk given for [Juvitop](https://math.mit.edu/juvitop/pastseminars/) in Spring 2023, which was about Floer Homotopy Theory. After the work of Abouzaid-Blumberg, I defined (framed) flow categories and flow bimodules, and constructed the infinity category of flow categories. I gave the proof that in the framed case, this is a stable infinity category and in fact equivalent to the category of finite spectra. Auxiliary material included some background on stability and how to recognise the category of finite spectra.
