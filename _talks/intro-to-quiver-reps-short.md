A short talk introducing some quiver theory. I classify simple representations of acyclic quivers, and discuss Gabriel's theorem. The [video is available on Youtube](https://youtu.be/SOQRlu1KeLA), and here are the [slides (PDF)](https://isabel-prime.github.io/files/slides-intro-to-quiver-reps.pdf).
