A short talk introducing some quiver theory. I classify simple representations of acyclic quivers, and discuss Gabriel's theorem. Available to watch [here](https://isabel-prime.github.io/files/slides-intro-to-quiver-reps.pdf), and the slides are [here](https://isabel-prime.github.io/files/slides-intro-to-quiver-reps.pdf).
