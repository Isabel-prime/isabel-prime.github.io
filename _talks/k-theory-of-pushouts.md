A 2.5-hour expository talk given for [Zygotop](https://nataliesstewart.github.io/zygotop/) in Spring 2023, a learning seminar for young graduate students interested in homotopy theory and related areas. I gave an overview of the Land-Tamme paper "On the K-theory of pushouts" shortly after it was uploaded to the arXiv. I stated and proved their main results, namely that we can measure the failure of excision for localising invariants (think K-theory) via the $$\oplus$$-construction, and that this $$\oplus$$-construction can be expressed as a pushout in $$\text{Alg}(k)$$ in good circumstances. This makes it computable in many situations of interest. The talk finished with a tour of some applications.
