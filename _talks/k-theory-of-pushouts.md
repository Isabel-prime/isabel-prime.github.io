A 2.5-hour expository talk given for [zygotop](https://zygotop.github.io/) in Spring 2023, a learning seminar for young graduate students interested in homotopy theory and related areas. I gave an overview of the Land-Tamme paper ["On the $$K$$-theory of pushouts"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12812) shortly after it was uploaded to the arXiv. I stated and proved their main results, namely that we can measure the failure of excision for localising invariants (think $$K$$-theory) via the $$\odot$$-construction, and that this $$\odot$$-construction can be expressed as a pushout in $$\text{Alg}(k)$$ in good circumstances. This makes it computable in many situations of interest. The talk finished with a tour of some applications.
