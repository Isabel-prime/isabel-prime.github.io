In Spring 2024, the [babytop](https://math.mit.edu/topology/babytop/index.html) seminar was about the paper ["On the rationalization of the K(n)-local sphere"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00960) by Barthel, Schlank, Stapleton, and Weinstein, and the two (p-adic) towers. I gave the last talk of the semester, explaining how to finish the proof of Theorem B by computing the pro&#233;tale cohomology of the Drinfeld symmetric space and the rigid analytic open unit disc. My talk covered Sections 6 and 3.9 of the paper.
