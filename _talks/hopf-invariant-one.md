An expository talk given for [zygotop](https://zygotop.github.io/) in Spring 2024, a learning seminar for young graduate students interested in homotopy theory and related areas. I gave an introduction to the Hopf invariant one problem and its solution, including the classical results relating real division algebra structures on $$\mathbb{R}^n$$, parallelizability of $$S^{n-1}$$, H-space structures on $$S^{n-1}$$, and elements of Hopf invariant one in $$\pi_{2n-1}(S^n)$$. I defined the Hopf invariant in terms of complex topological K-theory, and gave Adams-Atiyah's proof (using the splitting principle and Adams operations on topological K-theory) that elements of Hopf invariant $$\pm 1$$ exist only for $$n = 1, 2, 4, 8$$.
