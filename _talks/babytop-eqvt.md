In Fall 2024, the [babytop](https://math.mit.edu/topology/babytop/index.html) seminar was on Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel's resolution of the Kervaire invariant one problem. In this talk, I gave a brief introduction to equivariant homotopy theory. In the non-equivariant setting, homotopy theory is concerned with topological spaces up to weak equivalence. Before we can do equivariant homotopy theory, we need an equivariant notion of weak equivalence. Through a selection of examples, we try to motivate the relevant definitions. We then discuss Elmendorf's Theorem and how it gives us a very nice, concrete model for the $$\infty$$-category of G-spaces as presheaves on the orbit category. We conclude by saying a few words about equivariance in families. This talk was based on Chapter 1 of Blumberg's [Burnside Category](https://people.math.rochester.edu/faculty/doug/otherpapers/blumberg-burnside.pdf), and there are [notes](/files/eqvt-talk.pdf) I prepared.
