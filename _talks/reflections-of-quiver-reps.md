A 15-minute talk giving an introduction to derived reflection functors. We start with basic definitions, introduce the bounded derived category of quiver representations, and explain how derived reflection functors are induced from reflection functors. The upshot is that for an acyclic graph, any choice of edge orientations gives rise to the same derived category, with explicit isomorphisms via derived reflections. The [video](https://youtu.be/E0x_irPTBTY) is available to watch, and here are the [slides](https://isabel-prime.github.io/files/slides-reflections-of-quiver-reps.pdf).
