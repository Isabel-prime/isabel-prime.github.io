This talk was given as an attendee at the [2024 Talbot workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/talbotworkshop/past-talbots/talbot-2024), which was about THH of ring spectra. I gave a proof of the Segal conjecture for $$BP\langle n \rangle$$ by first proving it for graded polynomial $$\mathbb{E}_2$$-$$\mathbb{F}_p$$-algebras, and then using (the d&#233;calage of) the Adams filtration on $$BP\langle n \rangle$$ to reduce to the $$\mathbb{F}_p$$-algebra case. The talk was based on Section 4 of ["Redshift and multiplication for truncated Brown-Peterson spectra"](https://doi.org/10.4007/annals.2022.196.3.6) by Jeremy Hahn and Dylan Wilson. Notes from all the talks given at Talbot 2024 will eventually be available on the workshop website.
