The [Fall 2025 juvitop seminar](https://tbrazel.github.io/juvitop/index.html) was on Bloch-Kato. In this talk, I outlined the construction of norm varieties in all characteristics, and the proof that norm varieties are Rost varieties in characteristic zero. The material I presented was a condensed version of Chapters 10 and 11 of [Haesemeyer-Weibel](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/BK.pdf).
