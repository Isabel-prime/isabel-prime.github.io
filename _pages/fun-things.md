### Modular origami

Here is an icosahedron I assembled from [Sonobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonobe) units.

This model of five intersecting tetrahedra took quite a lot of fiddling to assemble correctly.

I learned about it [here](https://www.polypompholyx.com/2017/01/modularorigami/), along with many other designs, and [here](http://mars.wne.edu/~thull/fit.html) are instructions.
