### Cryptic crosswords

I enjoy both solving and designing cryptics. I have recently constructed two themed puzzles, which you can try [here](/cryptic-1) and [here](/cryptic-2). Lately I have been working through (and highly recommend!) [Ma&#772;ya&#772;'s](https://mayaofauckland.com/) cryptic collection.

### Modular origami

This solid icosahedron is built from the [triangle edge unit](https://www.mathdept.okstate.edu/mathclub/Minutes/origami_models.pdf) designed by Lewis Simon and Bennett Arnstein.

Here are two (stellated) icosahedra I assembled from [Sonobe units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonobe). One uses double-sided paper and a modified version of the unit with a reverse fold to expose the back.

This model of five intersecting tetrahedra was tricky to assemble correctly, but I am quite pleased with the result. I learned about it from a [blog post on modular origami](https://www.polypompholyx.com/2017/01/modularorigami/), along with many other designs, and followed [Thomas Hull's instructions](http://mars.wne.edu/~thull/fit.html) to build it.

This last model, Maria Sinayskaya's _etna kusudama_, is also based on the plan of a stellated icosahedron but with decorative holes in each point to give a floral appearance. Unlike the other models I have constructed, it would not hold together at all during construction and I had to use small paperclips at each joint to stabilise it. Once fully assembled, the clips can be removed and it seems fairly sturdy.
