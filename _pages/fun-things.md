### Modular origami

Here is an icosahedron I assembled from [Sonobe units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonobe).

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/Sonobe-Icosahedron-Fullsize-Compressed.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 300px;" alt="A Sonobe icosahedron in three colours" title="A Sonobe icosahedron in three colours. This was assembled from 30 Sonobe units."/></div>

This model of five intersecting tetrahedra was tricky to assemble correctly, but I am quite pleased with the result.

I learned about it from a [blog post on modular origami](https://www.polypompholyx.com/2017/01/modularorigami/), along with many other designs, and followed [Thomas Hull's instructions](http://mars.wne.edu/~thull/fit.html) to build it.
