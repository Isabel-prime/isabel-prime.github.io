### Modular origami

Here is an icosahedron I assembled from [Sonobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonobe) units.

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/Sonobe-Icosahedron.jpg" width="300px" alt="A Sonobe icosahedron in three colours" title="A Sonobe icosahedron in three colours. This was assembled from 30 Sonobe units."/></div>

This model of five intersecting tetrahedra was tricky to assemble correctly, but I am quite pleased with the result.

I learned about it [here](https://www.polypompholyx.com/2017/01/modularorigami/), along with many other designs, and [here](http://mars.wne.edu/~thull/fit.html) are the instructions I followed.
