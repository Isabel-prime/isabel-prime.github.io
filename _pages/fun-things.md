### Cryptic crosswords

I enjoy both solving and designing cryptics. Here is a [themed puzzle](https://isabel-prime.github.io/files/cryptic-1.pdf) I constructed (fillable format coming soon). It is completely solvable, although perhaps less entertaining, without understanding the theme. Lately I have been working through [Ma&#772;ya&#772;'s](https://mayaofauckland.com/) cryptic collection.

### Modular origami

Here is an icosahedron I assembled from [Sonobe units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonobe).

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/Sonobe-Icosahedron-Fullsize-Compressed.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: auto;" alt="A Sonobe icosahedron in three colours" title="A Sonobe icosahedron in three colours. This was assembled from 30 Sonobe units."/></div>

This model of five intersecting tetrahedra was tricky to assemble correctly, but I am quite pleased with the result.

<div><img src="/images/Five-Tetrahedra-Fullsize-Compressed.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: auto;" alt="An image of an origami model made from five interlocking tetrahedra" title="An origami model of five interlocking tetrahedra. The 20 vertices form a dodecahedron."/></div>

I learned about it from a [blog post on modular origami](https://www.polypompholyx.com/2017/01/modularorigami/), along with many other designs, and followed [Thomas Hull's instructions](http://mars.wne.edu/~thull/fit.html) to build it.
