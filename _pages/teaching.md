<!-- ## Private tutoring

In 2022, I am available for private WACE tutoring in mathematics (Methods and Specialist), physics, and chemistry. I am based in Perth, Western Australia with sessions held either online or in-person. I am also available to tutor motivated year 7-10 students in maths and science. Inquiries to [isabellongbottom@gmail.com](mailto:isabellongbottom@gmail.com); please include your year level, subject, desired location and availability.  -->

### As a Teaching Fellow at Harvard: 

* (Fall 2023) MATH 1B: Integration, Series, and Differential Equations

Teaching Fellows are responsible for delivering thrice-weekly classes to a section of 20-30 undergraduate students, including lecturing and leading the students through in-class problem sets. There is an emphasis on active learning.

### Directed Reading Program at Harvard:

The Directed Reading Program matches graduate student mentors with motivated undergraduates who are interested in mathematics, guiding them to learn about a topic outside the scope of the regular curriculum. For some of these students, this may be their first time encountering formal proofs. I have participated in this program in Fall 2022 and Fall 2023.
